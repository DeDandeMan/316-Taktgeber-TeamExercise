"THE DANG KLIMAANLAGE IS OUT!"
exclaimed Donald the Doener.
Around him, people argued on the Hauptstrasse about the broken Klimaanlage.
One man claimed he saw a Hund shove some Brot in the Klimaanlage
and it trotted past a bright red Porsche into the wide Biergarten
The heavy industrial beats of Rammstain echoed through the Hauptstrasse.
All while the man in the LederHose wondered why there was no Brot in the Baeckerei
Frank walked by and heard "Brot", "Hot", and "dog" and had a great idea.
He distracted the Hund with a Bratwurst, stole a BMW, and towed the broken Klimaanlage down the Hauptstrasse to the Schloss
